"""Wiring the layers together. The only component that knows all of them exist.

The ordering here encodes two rules:

**Coverage is resolved before anything runs.** The plan records, per sanitizer
component, whether it can operate and why not — so a finding count is always
interpretable. "No finding" from a sanitizer the planner marked unsupported does
not mean the model was clean.

**A failed execution is still judged.** Results are passed to sanitizers whether
or not they produced a trajectory, because the failure itself is an observation
and SolverSan exists to read it.
