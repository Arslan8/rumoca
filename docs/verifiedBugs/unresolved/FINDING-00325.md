## What remains unresolved

The current Rumoca nominal run is tool-error, before any reported perturbation. This prevents causal attribution to this parameter. Source metadata was recovered, but none of the reviewed source proofs or counterexamples establishes this particular claim. A baseline failure/tool limitation is neither confirmation nor a false positive.

## Source evidence

Compiler/source-resolved declaration: `Electrical/Analog/Semiconductors/PNP.mo:11`. Role: `parameter`; binding: `CapVal`; effective min: `0`; effective max: `None`.

## Execution evidence

[Rumoca commands, return codes, integrity hashes, bounded output and metadata](../evidence/f11c770db9a26ad4.json). Baseline: **tool-error**.

No independent runtime override was executed for this target in this audit; this is not a pass.

## Recommended action

Resolve the intended parameter domain and enclosing equations; check inherited bounds, final/protected status, guards and aliases. Construct an otherwise-valid source-level witness, establish a clean baseline in a capable engine, then retranslate at the witness and compare with the runtime override. For equality claims use the actual partner value. Do not apply a blanket min>0 fix yet.

## Scope and limitations

A source-level verdict addresses the reported declaration/claim, not every possible connected system. Tests cover 0–0.5 seconds and are not a proof of long-run stability. Shared instances are not distinct root causes. A missing bound, timeout, compiler error or failed nominal run alone never counts as a verified bug or a false positive. Fixes are proposals; no library/compiler implementation was changed.
