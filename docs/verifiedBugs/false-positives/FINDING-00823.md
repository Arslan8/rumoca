## Why this is a false positive

The library documentation explicitly says C may be positive or zero, and the constitutive equation is i=C*der(v), with no source division by C. At C=0 the component imposes i=0. Several reported runtime-override failures disappear after source-level recompilation and compatible initialization. A particular topology may still be singular, but the blanket strictly-positive rule contradicts the component contract.

## Source evidence

Compiler/source-resolved declaration: `Electrical/Analog/Basic/Capacitor.mo:4`. Role: `parameter`; binding: `derivative.C`; effective min: `0`; effective max: `None`.

Diagnostic: solve-IR evaluation failed: non-finite derivative evaluation for state 'ground.p.v'

## Recommended action

Correct the detector/adjudicator for this specific semantic case; do not impose a blanket strictly-positive bound on the library declaration.

## Scope and limitations

A source-level verdict addresses the reported declaration/claim, not every possible connected system. Tests cover 0–0.5 seconds and are not a proof of long-run stability. Shared instances are not distinct root causes. A missing bound, timeout, compiler error or failed nominal run alone never counts as a verified bug or a false positive. Fixes are proposals; no library/compiler implementation was changed.
