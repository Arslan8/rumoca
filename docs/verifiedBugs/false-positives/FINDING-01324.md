## Why this is a false positive

DC_PermanentMagnet declares protected constant SI.Inductance Lme=1. It is a fixed equivalence scale, not a user parameter, and cannot reach the claimed zero witness. The finding lost constant/final role information.

## Source evidence

Compiler/source-resolved declaration: `Electrical/Machines/BasicMachines/DCMachines/DC_PermanentMagnet.mo:38`. Role: `constant`; binding: `1`; effective min: `None`; effective max: `None`.

## Execution evidence

[Rumoca commands, return codes, integrity hashes, bounded output and metadata](../evidence/3f243142a2b979d6.json). Baseline: **tool-error**.

No independent runtime override was executed for this target in this audit; this is not a pass.

## Recommended action

Correct the detector/adjudicator for this specific semantic case; do not impose a blanket strictly-positive bound on the library declaration.

## Scope and limitations

A source-level verdict addresses the reported declaration/claim, not every possible connected system. Tests cover 0–0.5 seconds and are not a proof of long-run stability. Shared instances are not distinct root causes. A missing bound, timeout, compiler error or failed nominal run alone never counts as a verified bug or a false positive. Fixes are proposals; no library/compiler implementation was changed.
