## Why this is not a verified bug

The assignment that makes the denominator zero also makes the branch containing the division unreachable. The arithmetic witness is not an executable-path witness.

## Regression action

Keep this as a regression proving the detector suppresses or labels the non-defect correctly.

## Evidence basis

The v2 report's own verdict/proof explicitly declines a defect claim.

## Original claim

The assignment that zeroes the denominator also makes the branch containing the division unreachable, so the division is never evaluated at that value. It does **not** claim that anything is wrong.

## Scope

Confirmed means independently reproduced execution evidence survived the semantic controls. Candidate means useful static/source evidence exists but a false positive is still possible. Advisory means the analyzer explicitly asks about unknown intent and makes no defect claim. False-positive means the stated defect claim is refuted; it does not certify every connected topology. Unresolved entries are deliberately not called real or fake.
