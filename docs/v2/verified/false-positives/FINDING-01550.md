## Why this is not a verified bug

Ra is passed to Basic.Resistor, whose contract explicitly supports zero and signed resistance; zero removes armature copper loss. The partial machine source has no unconditional reciprocal of this parameter. A particular initialization can still be topology-dependent.

## Regression action

Correct the detector/adjudicator for this specific semantic case; do not impose a blanket strictly-positive bound on the library declaration.

## Evidence basis

Matched model/target source-semantic review from the first audit.

## Original claim

Nothing bounds this declaration at all, so it permits values the physical role forbids, including negative ones. It does **not** claim that any model actually sets such a value.

## Earlier independent review

[Prior report](../../../verifiedBugs/false-positives/FINDING-01366.md)

## Scope

Confirmed means independently reproduced execution evidence survived the semantic controls. Candidate means useful static/source evidence exists but a false positive is still possible. Advisory means the analyzer explicitly asks about unknown intent and makes no defect claim. False-positive means the stated defect claim is refuted; it does not certify every connected topology. Unresolved entries are deliberately not called real or fake.
