## Why this is not a verified bug

The quotient is a compiler-solved representation of a source equation whose zero value is an algebraic/feature limit. It does not prove a source-level division contract defect.

## Regression action

Keep this as a regression proving the detector suppresses or labels the non-defect correctly.

## Evidence basis

The v2 report's own verdict/proof explicitly declines a defect claim.

## Original claim

Zero is a supported limit of this component; the quotient the dae shows is the compiler's solved form, not a division in the source. It does **not** claim that the source contract is wrong.

## Scope

Confirmed means independently reproduced execution evidence survived the semantic controls. Candidate means useful static/source evidence exists but a false positive is still possible. Advisory means the analyzer explicitly asks about unknown intent and makes no defect claim. False-positive means the stated defect claim is refuted; it does not certify every connected topology. Unresolved entries are deliberately not called real or fake.
