## What remains unresolved

The denominator has an arithmetic zero witness, but the current IR cannot decide whether the division executes on that path.

## Evidence needed

Resolve the path/aggregate value and obtain a clean baseline before assigning blame.

## Evidence basis

The v2 analysis explicitly reports UNKNOWN or lacks independent baseline evidence.

## Original claim

An assignment drives the denominator to zero, but whether the division is evaluated there could not be decided from the artifact. It does **not** claim that the model is wrong — this is **unresolved**, not confirmed, and is reported so it is not silently dropped.

## Scope

Confirmed means independently reproduced execution evidence survived the semantic controls. Candidate means useful static/source evidence exists but a false positive is still possible. Advisory means the analyzer explicitly asks about unknown intent and makes no defect claim. False-positive means the stated defect claim is refuted; it does not certify every connected topology. Unresolved entries are deliberately not called real or fake.
