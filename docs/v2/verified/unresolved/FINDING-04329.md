## What remains unresolved

The current Rumoca nominal run is tool-error, before any reported perturbation. This prevents causal attribution to this parameter. Source metadata was recovered, but none of the reviewed source proofs or counterexamples establishes this particular claim. A baseline failure/tool limitation is neither confirmation nor a false positive.

## Evidence needed

Resolve the intended parameter domain and enclosing equations; check inherited bounds, final/protected status, guards and aliases. Construct an otherwise-valid source-level witness, establish a clean baseline in a capable engine, then retranslate at the witness and compare with the runtime override. For equality claims use the actual partner value. Do not apply a blanket min>0 fix yet.

## Evidence basis

Matched model/target source-semantic review from the first audit.

## Original claim

Nothing bounds this declaration at all, so it permits values the physical role forbids, including negative ones. It does **not** claim that any model actually sets such a value.

## Earlier independent review

[Prior report](../../../verifiedBugs/unresolved/FINDING-03861.md)

## Scope

Confirmed means independently reproduced execution evidence survived the semantic controls. Candidate means useful static/source evidence exists but a false positive is still possible. Advisory means the analyzer explicitly asks about unknown intent and makes no defect claim. False-positive means the stated defect claim is refuted; it does not certify every connected topology. Unresolved entries are deliberately not called real or fake.
