## What remains unresolved

Zero is a supported ideal lossless winding, while negative machine copper resistance is ordinarily unphysical. The old blanket-positive and blanket-signed readings are both too broad; this needs a component-scoped nonnegative contract.

## Evidence needed

Bind this declaration to a machine-winding role and enforce R >= 0; then regenerate the finding.

## Evidence basis

Re-review prompted by the distinction between generic signed Basic.Resistor and machine winding data.

## Original claim

Nothing bounds this declaration at all, so it permits values the physical role forbids, including negative ones. It does **not** claim that any model actually sets such a value.

## Scope

Confirmed means independently reproduced execution evidence survived the semantic controls. Candidate means useful static/source evidence exists but a false positive is still possible. Advisory means the analyzer explicitly asks about unknown intent and makes no defect claim. False-positive means the stated defect claim is refuted; it does not certify every connected topology. Unresolved entries are deliberately not called real or fake.
